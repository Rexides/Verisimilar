<h1>Introduction</h1>
<br/>
<p>Have you ever wanted to create your own quests, and integrate them seamlessly into the game with NPC quest givers, usable items, and even custom drops from mobs? Do you want to show those Blizzard quest designers that you are better than them at their own job? Are you a creative person who wants to put something back into the World of Warcraft? Then Verisimilar is the add-on you need.</p>
<br/>
<p>In addition, if you are a role player, Verisimilar can help you bring your storylines to life, by allowing you to impersonate NPCs, assign quests to the participants of your events, and hand out items you create.</p>

<h1>About Verisimilar</h1>
<br/>
<p>Verisimilar is a two-part add-on. One part is called Verisimilar Player, and is the client that players use to connect to other players who act as Game Masters, using the other part of the add-on called Verisimilar GM.</p>
<br/>
<p>Think of it as using your World of Warcraft client to connect to Blizzard&apos;s WoW servers. Just as you need WoW to actually play WoW, so you need Verisimilar if you want to experience the creations of other Verisimilar users, even if you don&apos;t plan to create anything. Additionally, you can play with other players&apos; creations only as they are online and you are connected to them, just how WoW servers need to be up and you logged in the game, in order to play WoW.</p>
<br/>
<p>This guide is about the Verisimilar Player part of the add-on, and will explain how you can connect to players using Verisimilar GM.</p>

<h1>Seamless Integration, and limits</h1>
<br/>
<p>The main feature of Verisimilar is it&apos;s ability to integrate your creations into the game in ways that make them hard to tell apart from Blizzard&apos;s content. Verisimilar quests go in the same quest log as Blizzard&apos;s quests, Verisimilar items go to the player&apos;s normal bags along with Blizzard&apos;s items, and when you assign custom loot to mobs, they show in the same loot window along with the normal game loot.</p>
<br/>
<p>Of course, there are some limitations. You cannot create new mobs or NPCs, you have to work with what&apos;s already in the game. Items you create may go into the player&apos;s bags, but there is no way to create equipable gear. And you will find that looting custom items from mobs follows different rules than normal loot.</p>

<h1>Legality</h1>
<br/>
<p>At this point you might be wandering, &#8220;is using this add-on legal?&#8220;. I can assure you that it is. Verisimilar was created solely by using Blizzard&apos;s interface API, which only allows add-ons to perform actions that are considered legal by Blizzard. Additionally, using Verisimilar does not give any kind of mechanical advantage to players, which is the reason Blizzard frowns upon tampering with game content. And finally, even if Blizzard decide that Verisimilar is illegal, then they will change their API in order to break it, instead of going after the users. So there is no reason to worry about using this add-on.</p>

<h1>Verisimilar and other add-ons</h1>
<br/>
<p>Due to the way Verisimilar was designed, it does not play well with other add-ons who try to modify or manage the same assets, for example quest log or bag management add-ons. If you find that you are getting errors or missing quests and items from Verisimilar, try disabling those add-ons.</p>
<br/>
<p>On the bright side, Verisimilar is not an add-on for everyday use. You have no reason to use Verisimilar while you are leveling, raiding, pvping or farming, and you can keep it disabled. You can choose to enable it only when you actually want to use it. In addition, you can choose not to integrate it with the normal game interface, which will also prevent those errors, but will result in less realistic looking quests and items.</p>
